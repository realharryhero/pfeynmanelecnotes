# Harry Fan's problem solutions for the Electrodynamics Feynman Lectures "course"

These will be my solutions for the Electrodynamics Feynman Lecture courses, in LaTeX / handwriting. These will be done while I am eating breakfast/lunch/dinner/whatever, to keep my mind busy. More reasons besides that involve learning how on earth I'll use all this Calculus stuff I learned, and basically real-world applications to mathematics, and to fuel my dreams in whatever.

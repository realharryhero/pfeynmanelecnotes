# Harry Fan's problem solutions for the Electrodynamics Feynman Lectures "course"

These will be my solutions for the Electrodynamics Feynman Lecture courses, in LaTeX / handwriting. These will be done while I am eating breakfast/lunch/dinner/whatever, to keep my mind busy (while reserving my non-eating mind for competition physics).

My source for the Feynman lectures comes from here: https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_toc.html
